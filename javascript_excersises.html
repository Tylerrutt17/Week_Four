<!-- Write a function that accepts string as an argument and if the string is less than 4 charecters return one message, 
    if it is greater than 12 return another message otherwise return a final message about being accepted.

    Write a function that accepts an argument named tempature. Have at least 6 ranges of tempature that represents a html valid color. 
Return the color based on the argument supplied when calling the function.
Use Switch. (hint do a google search for 'switch(true)' )

    Write a function that will return an array of arrays with 100 copies of each element in the array supplied in the as an argument of the function. 
The array in the parameter needs to be strings and needs to have at least 5 elements.
    (ridiculous unessery challenge..seriously dont try this unless you are just wanting a challange) 
    complete the above with the following requirements (it can be more than one function for this):
    Without mutating anything (strings, arrays etc). This means no variable can change and no array can be added to or removed from. (look up imutability)
    Without Using any loops
    Without using forEach, map, filter, or reduce.
(seriously please do not spend more than 30 minutes trying to do this) -->
